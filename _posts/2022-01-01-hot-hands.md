The game features 60 unique cards, player profiles with fully customizable decks that are stored online and a global chat for talking to other players.

I was responsible for sound design, audio systems, card collection and deck builder, chat, UI, menus, settings and part of the client side netcode.

The game is made with Unity and uses Amazon Web Services.
